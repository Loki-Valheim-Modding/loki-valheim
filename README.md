## Current mods

Please note that client mods should work on online servers as well, so respect the server rules and don't ruin the game for your friends.
Note that the mod configuration files (`BepInEx\config`) contain various options such as hotkeys to tweak to your hearts content!

- **First Person mode:** Allows you to play the game in first person. 
  - Multiple First-Person modes! Press H to cycle between: third person, first person without helmet and first person with helmet. 
  - What-You-See-Is-What-You-Hit (WYSIWYH): Instead of hitting things directly in front of you, the attack is now angled to where you are looking!
- **Immersion mode:** Aims to make the game more immersive
  - Removes the map and minimap! Press Ctrl+O to toggle.
  - By default, allow simple wooden poles & signs to be built without a nearby workbench. (Which you'll need without a minimap!)

  - Hides health bar of enemies and enemy bosses.
- **Autopickup filter:** Cycles between 3 modes when pressing L (accept all, block trash, block all) and has a customizable trash list in the config tailored for the endgame. Items won't be picked up automatically if blocked, but can still be picked up manually.
